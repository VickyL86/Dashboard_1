# Sports Betting Data Dashboard: 

Page Link: https://vickyl86.github.io/Dashboard_1/

This project was inspired by a growing Sports Betting industry. The created dashboard intends to show the revenue potential of the rapidly growing industry and explore different states' sports approaches to sports betting legalization. Since the Supreme Court's decision in 2018 to overturn the ban on sports betting, dozens of states have legalized online and in-person betting. Despite legalization, differences in state regulations have a visible effect on the industry's growth and tax revenues.

Factors with potential impact on the industry's growth:
- accessibility to placing bets
- taxation of gambling income

The Sports Betting dashboard consists of two pages visualizing changes in revenue growth on the National and state-specific levels.

The national site shows:
- progression in the legalization of sports betting across the US over the years
- the top 5 states by revenue upon load
- the overall revenue totals each state and as a total contribution since joining
- revenues over time broken down by ways to bet
- taxes over time broken down by ways to bet

State site depicts:
- state summary data
- tax & revenues over time
- revenue per capita over time

The project uses data BeautifulSoup scraped from sports betting websites and Census API. Files are fed into the javascript file via custom-created JSON file datasets. Data is set to be stored in a SQL database.
